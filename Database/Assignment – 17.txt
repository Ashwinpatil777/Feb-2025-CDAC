Constraining the Values of your data.
1) Create the Orders table so that all onum values as well as all combinations of
cnum and snum are different from one another, and so that NULL values are
excluded from the date field

Ans :- create table order1(
    -> onum char(4),
    -> cnum char(4),
    -> odate date not null,
    -> constraint p_k_1 primary key(onum,cnum));
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.04 sec)


2) Create the Salespeople table so that the default commission is 10% with no
NULLS permitted, snum is the primary key, and all names fall alphabetically
between A and M, inclusive (assume all names will be uppercase).
Asn:- 

CREATE TABLE salespeople1 (
    ->     snum INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ->     sname VARCHAR(10)
    ->         CHECK (UPPER(LEFT(sname, 1)) BETWEEN 'A' AND 'M'),
    ->     comm DECIMAL(5,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.10
    -> );

 insert into salespeople1 values
    -> (1,'mshwin',1);

3) Create the Orders table, making sure that the onum is greater than the cnum, and
the cnum is greater that the snum. Allow no NULLS in any of these three fields.
asn:-create table orders1 (
    -> onum char(4) not null,
    -> amt float,
    -> odate date,
    -> cnum char(4) not null,
    -> snum char(4) not null,
    -> constraint on_cn_sn check(onum > cnum and cnum>snum));
