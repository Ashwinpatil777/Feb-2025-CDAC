10. What is the difference between COUNT(Status) and COUNT(*) ? 
Ans: count(status) ->> they display only count in statue  rows
     count(*) --> they display all count in the  rows
COUNT(*)
Counts all rows in the result set, including rows with NULL values in any column.

It doesn’t matter what’s inside the columns — every row is counted.
COUNT(Status)
Counts only the rows where Status is NOT NULL.

If Status is NULL in a row, that row is not counted.
